# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Trees is a non-linear data structure that does not store in a sequential manner.
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
it required from us to traversal in different ways

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I visualized the problem then started implementing each method and made it work by trying each time.
pre-order,in-order,and post-order => big O(n) time/space complexity.

addingValue=> big O(h) time complexity where h is height of the tree, big O(1) space complexity.



## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
1. pre-order: It arranges the nodes in the tree to root=>left=>right.
2. in-order:  It arranges the nodes in the tree to left=>root=>right.
3. post-order: It arranges the nodes in the tree to left=>right=>root.
4. addingValue: It adds new node to the tree.
5. containsValue: It search for the if it contains a specific node  or not.
