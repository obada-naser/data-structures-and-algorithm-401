## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
1. I did the problem domain and visualized the problem domain and used the blog to draw the steps.
2. then I did the big O that happened to be  O(n^2) time O(1) space.
3. then I wrote the code using IntellIJ.
4. verified my solution using the tests.
