# Graphs
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Graphs is a collection of vertices that is connected by line segments and we called it edges. 

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
It is required to implement a graph by implementing node,edges,and the neighbors.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
1. I did the problem domain and visualized the problem domain.
2. then I did the big O that happened to be  O(n) time O(n) space.
3. then I wrote the code using IntellIJ.
4. verified my solution using the tests


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in your Graph -->
addVertices: adding vertex to the graph.
addEdge: Adding edges to connect between two nodes.
getVertex: getting the vertices of the graph.
getNeighbors: getting the edges connected to the node.
size: getting the whole size of the graph.
