# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
stack and queues is a data structuring that consists of nodes but the difference how they add or remove the nodes from them.   

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
the challenge was about to add,remove,find the peak, and check if the stack or queue is empty by using different methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I did it by visualizing each method and implement it them using different methods. the big O time/space is big O(1).

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
### Stack methods:

* push: I added a method who can insert a node into the stack and as we know the stack is First In Last Out or Last In First Out, so the first node will be in the last.
* pop: I added a method who removes the node who is in the top.

* peek: method to show the top of the stack.

* isEmpty: to check if the stack is empty.


### Queue methods:

*  Enqueue: I added a method who can insert a node into the Queue and as we know the Queue is First In First Out or Last In Last Out, so the newly added will be in the rear.
* pop: I added a method who removes the node who is in the front.

* peek: method to show the top of the queue.

* isEmpty: to check if the queue is empty.
