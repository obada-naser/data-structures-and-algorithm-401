## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
1. I did the problem domain and visualized the problem domain
2. then I did the big O that happened to be O(n) time O(1) space. 
3. then I wrote the code using IntellIJ.
4. verified my solution using the tests.


## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
