# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
HashTables is a data structure that is used to a hash a key and get from it the value without looping over an array.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
It required from us to implement a hashTable class that can add,get, and test the existence.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I visualized how the hashTable works then started implementing each method and made it work by trying each time.
Hash,add,get,and test => big O(1) time/space complexity for the hashTables and for my approach it has taken big O(n) time/space for looping on input.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->

* **hash :** takes the key then by using the built-in hashing we hashed it and then got the modules of it and returned the index.

* **add :** adds a new key value pairs. 

* **get :** gets the value for the given key.

* **contains :** check if there is any value for the given key and returns a boolean.
