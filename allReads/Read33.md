# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Hashmaps is used to hash key and values and we can uses this method to get the values of each key.


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
It is a challenge to utilize the hashmap and uses two hashmaps and join them in one array only if both hashmaps has the same keys.



## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
1. I did the problem domain and visualized the problem domain and used the blog to draw the steps.
2. then I did the big O that happened to be  O(n) time O(n) space.
3. then I wrote the code using IntellIJ.
4. verified my solution using the tests.
